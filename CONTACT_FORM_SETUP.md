## ðŸ’¡ Alternative: Use Netlify Function + Email Service

If you want more control over email formatting or want to use a custom email service:

1. Install an email service SDK (SendGrid, Resend, Mailgun):
```bash
npm install @sendgrid/mail
# or
npm install resend
```

2. Add environment variable in Netlify:
   - Go to Site settings â†’ Environment variables
   - Add `SENDGRID_API_KEY` or `RESEND_API_KEY`
   - Get API key from your email service

3. Update `netlify/functions/contact.ts` to use the email service

4. Change form to POST to `/.netlify/functions/contact`
